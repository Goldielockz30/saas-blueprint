## 🏃🏾‍♀️⚡ Fast-Track Your SaaS Development

This **SaaS-Blueprint** is a clean, minimal, developer-ready starter kit designed to help you launch full-stack SaaS applications quickly and confidently.

---

## 💥 Problems I Solve
* 🔒 **Built-in security** — No messy fixes later. Your app starts off safe and stays that way.
* 📈 **Ready to grow** — The architecture is designed to scale without hitting performance roadblocks.
* ⏳ **Faster turnaround** — I cut typical build times from 3–6 months down to about 1 month with 1–2 months of ongoing improvements and support.
* 🛠 **No more starting from scratch** —  I use my own blueprint snapshots to quickly customize and complete your project, and we can continue to build if you want more features.
* 💰 **High-end results without a huge team** — I deliver for £10–20k over a 3-month retainer, not £50–100k like big dev agencies.

## 🛠️ For Developers Getting Started Locally

See [`prerequisites.md`](docs/prerequisites.md) for install instructions:

- VS Code (recommended)
- Python 3.11.9
- Node.js 18+ (LTS version, includes npm)
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Git + GitHub account
- **WSL (Ubuntu)** installed if you’re on Windows ([Microsoft Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install))
  - In VS Code, install the **Remote - WSL** extension
  - You’ll run all commands from the **WSL: Ubuntu** terminal

---

> 🛠 **Note:** All setup is done from inside the **Ubuntu (WSL)** terminal on Windows, or the default terminal on macOS/Linux.
> This ensures Python, npm, and Git hooks are installed in a Linux environment — matching deployment.

## ⚙️ Quickstart

   1. Open a WSL Terminal

In VS Code, open the terminal dropdown and select **"WSL: Ubuntu"**.

> Open VS Code in WSL Mode (so you can see the project in the sidebar)

> Press Ctrl+Shift+P → type "WSL: New Window" → select "WSL: Ubuntu"

In the WSL terminal that opens in the VS Code pop up window run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/projects   # Create a projects folder in the home dir if it doesn't exist
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/Goldielockz30/saas-blueprint.git blueprint
cd blueprint
code .
```
A new VS Code window will open showing your blueprint folder on the left — this is your main project workspace.
Close all other VS Code windows so you don’t edit the wrong folder by mistake.

2. Then run the setup script:

```bash
cd ~/projects/blueprint
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

💡 Tip: Your terminal location matters. If you’ve opened a new terminal window and it’s not in the project folder, run `pwd` to check your path or manually navigate back with `cd ~/projects/blueprint`

## 🪄 What Happens After You Clone

Cloning this repo using the instructions in my README does more than just download files — it **triggers a smart setup loop** that prepares your environment behind the scenes.

### 🔁 Automation flow:

```text
README instructions (manual)
└──▶📝setup-local-blueprint.sh
     └──▶⚡activate-pre-commit.sh
           └──▶🔒pre-commit-git-hook.sh
```

### What this does:

- ✅ Sets up a fresh repo just for you
- ✅ Creates your `.env` file automatically from `.env.example`
- ✅ Installs Git hooks to block secrets from being committed
- ✅ Prepares the local workspace for secrets, Docker, and development

You’ll still configure your own credentials and files —
but the **leak-proof safety system is fully automated** and already active.

3. **Install Backend**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
```
4. **Install Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```
5. **Run Services**
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
uvicorn src.main:app --reload

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

🪄 ***Want to skip manual setup?** My private automation scripts condense this into a single command, available in my premium starter kit.*

## 📂 Project Structure


See [folder-structure.md](./docs/folder-structure.md) for a full visual breakdown of the repo layout.

---


> 🔐 **Important:** This blueprint includes a Git hook system that automatically blocks commits containing secrets like `.env`, `.env.local`, or `secrets.toml`.
> The hook is auto-installed by `activate-pre-commit`, which runs during setup via `setup-local-blueprint.sh`.
> I never push `.env` to git, all keys are stored using doppler secrets management with `env.enc` as the local fallback.
